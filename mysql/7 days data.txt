SELECT * FROM Table_Name
WHERE connect_time >= DATE_ADD(CURDATE(),INTERVAL -7 DAY);
or

SELECT * FROM Table_Name
WHERE connect_time >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(),INTERVAL 7 DAY);
Without those functions, you can also do

SELECT * FROM Table_Name
WHERE connect_time >= (CURDATE() + INTERVAL -7 DAY);
or

SELECT * FROM Table_Name
WHERE connect_time >= (CURDATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY);
